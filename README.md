# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. It was by trial and error that I now suspect that only by having a Readme file that I will be able to add a branch. I could have added a fork, but not a branch.
Although my background is in manual labor, I am excited to be enrolled in codeky. Whether I wind up working in the field or not, I can see these skills as very useful to be familiar with as technology evolves. Now I am wondering how to read the extended description I added.
